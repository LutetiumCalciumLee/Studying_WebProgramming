# Chapter 1 . Web Basics


**Key Points:**

- **Purpose and Structure of the Web**  
  The web was created to share and view documents across multiple computers. Web documents are specifically designed for the web, distinct from other electronic documents. The World Wide Web (WWW) is a network of information, interconnected like a spider’s web, using the internet as its foundation.

- **Web Components**  
  The web consists of web servers (which store and manage web content) and web clients (browsers that request and display content). Web servers respond to client requests by sending web documents, images, and other data. Web clients (browsers) provide the user interface and handle displaying the received content.

- **Internet vs. Web**  
  The internet is a broader network infrastructure established before the web, supporting various services like email, file transfer, and chat. The web is just one of many services running on the internet, focused on sharing hyperlinked documents.

- **Web Browsers**  
  Early browsers included WorldWideWeb (later Nexus), Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. Each browser has unique features and market share has shifted over time, with Chrome being the most widely used as of recent years.

- **Building a Website**  
  Setting up a website involves installing web server software, storing web pages and media, and developing server applications as needed. Popular web server software includes Apache, IIS, nginx, and Google Web Server. Server applications can be built using languages like JavaScript, JSP, Java, C/C++, PHP, Perl, and Python.

- **Web Documents vs. Electronic Documents**  
  Electronic documents (like Word files) are stored as single files containing all content. Web documents are written in HTML, stored as separate files per page, and linked via hyperlinks. Web pages store only text; images and media are kept as separate files and referenced within the page.

- **URLs and HTTP**  
  A web page’s address (URL) includes the protocol, server address, port number, path, and file name. Communication between browsers and servers is managed by the HTTP protocol, which defines how requests and responses are handled.

- **The Birth and Success of the Web**  
  Tim Berners-Lee proposed the web in 1989 and developed the first web server and browser at CERN. The web succeeded due to the simplicity of HTML, efficient HTTP communication, and clear separation of server and client responsibilities.

- **Ubiquity of the Web**  
  The web is now a fundamental platform for information and device management, used in TVs, routers, and more. Web servers are often embedded in devices to provide easy configuration via browsers.

- **Web Page Structure: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**  
  HTML defines the structure and content. CSS styles the appearance. JavaScript handles behavior and interactivity. These components are developed separately for modularity and flexibility.

- **HTML5: Purpose and Features**  
  HTML5 was created to address compatibility issues and the growing diversity of internet devices. It aims to provide a universal standard that works across PCs, mobile devices, and more, eliminating the need for plugins like Flash or ActiveX. HTML5 supports advanced features like multimedia (audio, video), graphics (Canvas, SVG), offline applications, geolocation, and more, with standardized APIs.

- **Editing HTML5 Documents**  
  HTML5 files can be created with any text editor and should be saved in UTF-8 encoding. WYSIWYG editors (like Dreamweaver or Sublime Text) offer visual editing and error checking.

- **Debugging and Validation**  
  Browsers provide developer tools for debugging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Validation tools help ensure code adheres to standards.
