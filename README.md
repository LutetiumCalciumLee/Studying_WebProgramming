# Chapter 5. Advanced CSS3 Usage


**Key Topics:**

- **Element Layout and Positioning:**  
  CSS3 allows precise control over where elements appear using properties like `display`, `position` (static, relative, absolute, fixed), `float`, `z-index`, `visibility`, and `overflow`. You can distinguish between block, inline, and inline-block boxes to manage how elements flow and stack on the page.

- **List Styling:**  
  Lists can be customized with properties such as `list-style-type`, `list-style-image`, and `list-style-position` to change marker shapes, use custom images, or adjust marker placement. You can also style backgrounds and spacing for both lists and list items.

- **Table Styling:**  
  CSS3 enables detailed table customization, including border styles, cell padding, alignment, background colors, zebra striping (alternating row colors), and hover effects. Properties like `border-collapse`, `padding`, `text-align`, and `nth-child()` are used for these effects.

- **Form Styling:**  
  Forms and inputs can be styled with colors, borders, rounded corners, and interactive states using pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:focus`. CSS3 allows dynamic feedback, such as changing background color or font size when users interact with form fields.

- **Dynamic Effects:**  
  - **Animation:** Use `@keyframes` to define how styles change over time, creating effects like color changes or resizing that repeat or run for a set duration.  
  - **Transition:** The `transition` property enables smooth changes between style states, such as gradually increasing font size or changing color on hover.  
  - **Transform:** The `transform` property allows geometric changes like rotation, scaling, translation (moving), and skewing of elements, often in response to user actions.

- **3D Transformations and Interactivity:**  
  Advanced techniques include 3D transforms using `perspective`, `transform-style`, and `translateZ`, enabling effects like card flips and layered depth. Interactive effects can be triggered on hover or click, and combining transforms with shadows enhances realism and user engagement.

- **Best Practices for Animation:**  
  For smooth, performance-friendly animations, use `transform` and `opacity` instead of properties like `width`, `height`, or positional values, as these can cause layout shifts and reflows.
