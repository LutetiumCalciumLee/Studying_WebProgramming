# Chapter 6. JavaScript Basics


### What is JavaScript?
- Lightweight, interpreted scripting language created in 1995.
- Embedded in HTML and executed by browsers.
- Powers interactivity and dynamic content on web pages.

---

### How to Use JavaScript in HTML
- Place code directly in HTML event handler attributes (e.g., `onclick`).
- Insert code inside `` tags in the `` or ``.
- Use external `.js` files for modularity and reusability.

---

### Output and Dialogs
- Display content with `document.write()`.
- Interact with users using:
  - `alert()` – show messages
  - `prompt()` – get user input
  - `confirm()` – get confirmation

---

### Variables and Data Types
- Declare variables with `var`, `let`, or `const`.
- Store numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, etc.
- Dynamically typed—variable types can change at runtime.

---

### Operators
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.
- Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Bitwise and conditional (ternary) operators

---

### Control Structures
- **Conditional statements:** `if`, `if-else`, `switch`
- **Loops:** `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- Use `break` and `continue` to control loop flow

---

### Functions
- Reusable code blocks defined with the `function` keyword
- Accept parameters and return values
- Can be called multiple times with different arguments

---

### Scope
- Global and local variables, determined by where they are declared

---

### Built-in Functions
- `eval()` – evaluate expressions
- `parseInt()` – convert strings to integers
- `isNaN()` – check for non-numeric values

---

### Event Handling
- Respond to user actions (clicks, key presses, etc.)
- Assign code to HTML event attributes or use event listeners for dynamic behavior
