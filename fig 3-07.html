      <p>
        Mozart was born in Salzburg on January 27, 1756. He learned piano and violin from his father, who was a court musician. He began composing at the age of five, and between 1764 and 1765, he learned how to compose symphonies from Bach, which led him to write many symphonies. In Vienna in 1784, Mozart met the 14-year-old Beethoven and devoted himself to teaching him.
